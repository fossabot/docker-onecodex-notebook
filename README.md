This repository includes a base Docker image capable of running Jupyter notebooks embedded in the One Codex platform. It generally includes a superset of the packages found in the Jupyter Project's [scipy-notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/blob/master/scipy-notebook/Dockerfile) and [r-notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/blob/master/r-notebook/Dockerfile) and supports Python 2, Python 3, and R. See the Dockerfile for additional bioinformatics tools installed by default.
